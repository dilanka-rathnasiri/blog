- We can consider Kubernetes objects as the build blocks of a Kubernetes cluster
- Each Kubernetes object has its own specific attributes and responsibilities
- There are many Kubernetes objects

## What is a Pod?

- In Kubernetes, pods are the smallest deployable units of computing
- Kubernetes pods are one object of the Kubernetes objects
